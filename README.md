# website-task-tracker
 A website for tracking tasks where anyone can access and add tasks to the site.
 
This website does not reload the page whenever a selection is made, this is done using JavaScript and the XMLHttpRequest object.
This works with google chrome but not guaranteed to work with other broswers.

JSON is used to track, transfer, and store all of the task information that is added and or requested.
All of the data is stored on the server

The emphasis of this project being more server side processing orientated.
